# ISIM-Adapter-for-ISIM
This adapter for IBM Security Identity Manager allows you to provision from an ISIM Supplier environment to an ISIM Consumer environment. This adapter works like any other and the Consumer Person entries will appear as ISIM accounts in the Supplier.

The adapter has been written using IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator 7.0 and testing performed using IBM Tivoli Directory 7.1.1 RMI service.

The adapter uses LDAP for reconciliation of Person entries and connects to ITIM/ISIM using DSML2 over JNDI.
